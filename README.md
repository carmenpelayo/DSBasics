# Data Science Basics

This repo includes some notebooks I frequently use in my data science endeavors. It includes:
+  An ***Analytics*** notebook, with the main techniques for data preprocessing, manipulation, and visualization, as well as for performing simple statistical analyses.
+  A ***Forecasting*** notebook, with examples of various basic forecasting models for regression, classification, and clustering. It also includes some sample neural network architectures.

This is a work in progress.
